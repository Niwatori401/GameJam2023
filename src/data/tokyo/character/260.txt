Thank you!  I wish I could repay your generosity...
Oh! You have more? I think I can manage.
Oh, it's all so good!
I really should be watching what I eat...
Oh my, you're... quite enthusiastic...
Could I... possibly trouble you for a little more? Sorry.
*light burp* - Excuse me...
*faint gurgle* - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Oh, it's all so good!
