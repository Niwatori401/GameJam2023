Welcome to the fabled Tutorial Zone!
I am the last of the Tutorial Penguins, and I am here to pass on my immense knowledge!
TREMBLE before my mastery of puzzles! SEE how the bubbles COLLAPSE at my command!
...you don't appear to be TREMBLING.
Right, moving on, then.
This game is based on the arcade game "Puzzle Bobble"
Some aspects of the game are the same. For example, connect at least three "bobbles" to pop the rest.
Any left floating will be popped as well.
Aim with LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys and fire with UP.
You can aim more slowly for better accuracy if you hold SHIFT.
If bobbles reach the red line by your shooter, you lose.
The circle to the right of the shooter indicates how long until the next row comes.
Gain points by popping bobbles.
Now, go unto the world and romance those babes.
If you find any penguin lovers put in a good word, yeah?
As far as difficulty, Texas is easiest, followed by India and Japan.
Press ESCAPE to leave any level, at any time.
That's all for now. You can always come back through the level select screen.
Unless I explode. Which I shouldn't, but who's to say?
