Whew...
You might just do it after all.
Did you think I was done? That's disappointing.
*BUARP* - Hahaha! Think of that as your reward.
Quit staring and keep feeding.
More? Oh, yes, certainly.
So many spices...so little time.
I might have to keep you around a little longer.
Whoops! Did we do that?
Oh, you're not going to stop now, are you?
A little thing like this shouldn't be a problem...
*loud gurgle* - W-woah...
*BUUUUARP* - Well? Don't just stand there.
You don't HAVE to stop, you know.
Look what you've done...great work.
